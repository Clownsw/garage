Object table
------------


Rename version table to object table
In value handle the different versions

So that the table becomes bucket + Sort key = object key -> CRDT(list of versions)

CRDT merge rule:
- keep one complete version (the one with the highest timestamp)
- keep all incomplete versions with timestamps higher than the complete version

Cleanup rule: remove incomplete versions after a given delay (say 24h)


Block table
-----------

Table is version_UUID -> BTreeMap<(offset, block hash)> OR Deleted (= CRDT top)


Block reference table
---------------------

Table is block_Hash + Sort key: version_UUID -> boolean (true when deleted)

Since the hash key is the same as for the blocks themselves,
we can simply consider the updates to this table as events that increase/decrease a reference counter.
