Testing
-------

How are we going to test that our replication method works correctly?
We will have to introduce lots of dummy data and then add/remove nodes many times.


Improvements
------------

Membership: keep IP addresses of failed nodes and try to reping them regularly

RPC client/server: do not go through the serialization+HTTP+TLS+deserialization when doing a request to ourself.

RPC requests: unify quorum + timeout in a "RequestStrategy" class,
and add to the request strategy whether or not the request should continue in the background
once `quorum` valid responses have been received


Attaining S3 compatibility
--------------------------

- table for access keys
- S3 request signature verification
- api_server following the S3 semantics for get/put/delete
- implement object listing
- possibly other necessary endpoints ?


Lower priority
--------------

- less a priority: hinted handoff
- repair: re-propagate block ref table to rc
- FIXME in rpc_server when garage shuts down and futures can be interrupted
  (tokio::spawn should be replaced by a new function background::spawn_joinable)
