# Working Documents

Working documents are documents that reflect the fact that Garage is a software that evolves quickly.
They are a way to communicate our ideas, our changes, and so on.

Ideally, while the feature/patch has been merged, the working document should serve as a source to 
update the rest of the documentation.
