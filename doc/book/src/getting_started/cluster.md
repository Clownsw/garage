## Test cluster

## Real-world cluster

For our example, we will suppose we have the following infrastructure:

| Location | Name    | IP Address | Disk Space |
|----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Paris    | Mercury | fc00:1::1  | 1 To       |
| Paris    | Venus   | fc00:1::2  | 2 To       |
| London   | Earth   | fc00:1::2  | 2 To       |
| Brussels | Mars    | fc00:B::1  | 1.5 To     |
